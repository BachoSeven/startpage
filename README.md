# startpage

A simple html startpage and [new tab](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/change-new-tab/mocklpfdimiadpbgamlgehpgpodggahe "new tab extension").

## motivation

A part from the obvious aesthetics, I also made this so I could use **[Vimium](https://github.com/philc/vimium)** on a decent new tab, rather than pages/blank.html (see this [issue](https://github.com/philc/vimium/issues/1515 "issue link")).

## search bar
I use Vomnibar for most searches (my own bangs > duckduckgo's), but I have added in a "hidden" ddg search bar, which is focused by pressing `Space`. (it also takes autofocus, but if you use Vimium it only takes autofocus before vimium loads, so if you press `t` to open a new tab and then immediately start typing).
