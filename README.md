# startpage
A simple html page for my browser, as well as for [new tabs](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/change-new-tab/mocklpfdimiadpbgamlgehpgpodggahe "new tab extension").

I made it so I could use *Vimium* on new tabs rather than having to use pages/blank.html (see this [issue](https://github.com/philc/vimium/issues/1515 "issue link") ).

I use Vomnibar for most searches (my own bangs > duckduckgo's), but I have added in a hidden ddg search bar (which only takes autofocus before vimium loads, so if I press `t` and then immediately start typing, I can search in it directly).
